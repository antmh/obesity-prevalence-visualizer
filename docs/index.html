          <p>
            Obesity Prevalence Visualizer is a website that allows users to view statistics
            related to the body mass index. These statistics are gathered from external
            sources. This tool allows users to visualize this data in various different
            forms and to export them in different file formats. Users may also make use of a
            REST API.

          <h3>Software Interfaces</h3>
          <p>
            This tool requires on the server side PHP 8 with the Curl and
            multi-byte string extensions enables. SQLite version 3 is also
            required to store the data.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Communication Interfaces</h3>
          <p>
            The web pages are transferred over HTTP/HTTPS. For authentication
            HTTPS is preferred in order prevent attacks. The data gathered from
            Eurostat and the World Health Organization is gathered through their
            respective REST API which server JSON documents. This site's REST
            API functions the same way.

        <h2>System Features</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Authentication</h3>
          <p>
            The user can enter their username and password. After pressing the
            login button the server will validate their request and if
            successful they can access the administration panel.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Administration</h3>
          <p>
            Two buttons used for clearing and updating data are provided for
            both sources, Eurostat and the World Health Organization.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Bar Chart Visualization</h3>
          <p>
            The statistics that are shown can be configured by selecting the
            attributes, the order and data that has an attribute of a certain
            value. The user can select a certain bar to show a popup showing
            more information.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Table Visualization</h3>
          <p>
            The configuration acts the same way as in the previous section, but
            it is shown as a table.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Line Chart Visualization</h3>
          <p>
            The only configuration that can be done is selecting which
            attributes are shown and selecting data with an attribute of a
            certain value. The points are ordered chronologically.

        <h2>Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Performance Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of memory this tool requires at least 512M of RAM to be
            able to parse and insert the JSON file provided by the World Health
            Organization which has a size of a few tens of megabytes.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Safety Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            The data can be safely redownloaded from the the sources in case of
            a system failure.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Security Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            No data is stored or gathered from ordinary users, so there are no
            system requirements for them. The administrator needs to insert
            their authentication information so HTTPS would be a requirement in
            case the administration panel is used.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Software Quality Attributes</h3>
          <p>
            Besides the various way to visualize the data, the site is
            responsive and can be used on devices with small screens such as
            tablets or smartphones. The home page is useful for showing the
            users the features of the tool.
