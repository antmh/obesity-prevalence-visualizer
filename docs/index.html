          <h3>Product Scope</h3>
          <p>
            Obesity Prevalence Visualizer is a website that allows users to view statistics
            related to the body mass index. These statistics are gathered from external
            sources. This tool allows users to visualize this data in various different
            forms and to export them in different file formats. Users may also make use of a
            REST API.

        <section>
          <h3>Product Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            Obesity Prevalence Visualizer is a website that offers statistics
            about the body mass index in various countries and regions around
            the world. These statistics can be visualized as tables, line charts
            and bar charts. The two sources of the data are Eurostat and the
            World Health Organization.

          <h3>Software Interfaces</h3>
          <p>
            This tool requires on the server side PHP 8 with the Curl and
            multi-byte string extensions enables. SQLite version 3 is also
            required to store the data. Gnuplot is also required for the export
            functionality to work for SVG and PNG.

        <section>
          <h3>Communication Interfaces</h3>
          <p>
            The web pages are transferred over HTTP/HTTPS. For authentication
            HTTPS is preferred in order prevent attacks. The data gathered from
            Eurostat and the World Health Organization is gathered through
            their respective REST API which server JSON documents. This
            application's REST API also uses JSON transferred over HTTP and
            uses JSON Web Tokens for actions which need authentication.

        <h2>System Features</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Product presentation</h3>
          <p>
            On the home page the scope of this product is presented explaining
            the features. There is also an explanation of the body mass index
            is and its categories. To showcase the features there are example
            line charts, bar charts and tables with data gathered from the
            database to illustrate the ways in which data can be visualized.
            The charts and tables on this page cannot be configured.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Statistics visualization</h3>
          <p>
            Two separate pages can be accessed to visualize data from Eurostat
            and WHO.
          </p>
          <p>
            On each of these pages the user has the option to select from a bar
            chart, line chart or table as a type of representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can also select which properties are shown (year, value,
            location, etc.). This data will be shown in a bar chart when a user
            hovers or clicks a bar. In the case of a line chart, the data will
            be shown when the user hovers or clicks a point. For a table these
            properties represent the columns which are shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can select for each column in what order the values are
            shown, either ascending or descending. They can also specify how
            this ordering is done (e.g. order after location, then year if the
            location is the same). These options are only available for bar
            charts and tables.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can also filter the data so only statistics with a certain
            value are shown (e.g. to show only data from 2014). This filtering
            applies for all three types of visualizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can optionally export to a particular format: CSV for
            tables, SVG or PNG for line charts and bar charts.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Authentication</h3>
          <p>
            The user can enter their e-mail and password. After pressing the
            login button the server will validate their request and if
            successful they can access the administration panel and they are
            logged in for the duration of the session.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Administration</h3>
          <p>
            The user has the ability to change their e-mail and password (there
            are two fields for the password, because the user has to confirm
            it). Before changing this information the user has to insert their
            (old) password.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user has two links which can take him to two different pages to
            change the data from Eurostat and WHO. Each of these pages will
            have a paginated table showing all the rows from the table in the
            database. Each of these rows has a button that allows the user to
            remove that particular row. Above the table there are text fields
            corresponding to each column in the table that allow the user to
            insert a new row. There are also buttons for clearing all the data
            from the table and for downloading and inserting the data from
            Eurostat and WHO.
          </p>

        <h2>Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Performance Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of memory this tool requires at least 512M of RAM to be
            able to parse and insert the JSON file provided by the World Health
            Organization which has a size of a few tens of megabytes.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Safety Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            The data can be safely redownloaded from the the sources in case of
            a system failure.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Security Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            No data is stored or gathered from ordinary users, so there are no
            system requirements for them. The administrator needs to insert
            their authentication information so HTTPS would be a requirement in
            case the administration panel is used.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Software Quality Attributes</h3>
          <p>
            Besides the various way to visualize the data, the site is
            responsive and can be used on devices with small screens such as
            tablets or smartphones. The home page is useful for showing the
            users the features of the tool.
