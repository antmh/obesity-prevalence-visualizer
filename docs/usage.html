        <h2>Usage guide</h2>
        <p>
          The user is first presented with a home page where they can
          choose wheter to see data from Eurostat or WHO. At the bottom,
          there are also examples of the types that the date can be
          visualized in.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a user visits the WHO or Eurostat page, they are
          presented with a list of filters to control the way the data
          is shown.
        <p>
          First, there is a radio button group to control if the data is
          shown as a table, a bar chart or a line chart. Below, there is
          a check box group to set which properties are shown. There is
          also a component which controls the order.  In this component,
          there are entries for each property. To the left of the entry
          there is a button that toggles wheter the order is ascending
          or descending. To the right of the entry there are two buttons
          to control if the data should be sorted before or after some
          entries. There is also a filter component presented with
          drop-downs for each column. Here a certain value can be
          selected to show only data with that value. At the end there
          is an export radio button box to select the format to which to
          optionally export.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the user presses the submit button the visualization is
          updated according to the preferences selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the log in page, which can be accessed through the
          navigation bar, the user first has to authenticate with a
          username and a password. After successfully logging in, they
          can change their password or username. If they do one of these
          actions they must insert their current password first.  They
          can also access pages which allow them to insert and delete
          data from WHO or Eurostat. On these pages, a clear button can
          be pressed to delete all the data. There is also an insert
          button to download data from the original sources again and to
          insert them, this may take several seconds.  Below, there is a
          form to insert a new row. Finally, there is a paginated table,
          where each row has a delete button which the user can press to
          delete that row.
