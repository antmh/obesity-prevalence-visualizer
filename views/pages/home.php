    <h1>What is obesity?</h1>
    <p>
        Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to
        an extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered
        obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the
        square of the person's height—despite known allometric inaccuracies is over 30 kg/m2;
        the range 25–30 kg/m2 is defined as overweight.
